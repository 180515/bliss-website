	<h3>About our retreats</h3>
	<p>We provide exclusive service to make sure young women get the opportunity to experience a week of retreats in order to find their true inner self. For people who are shorter in cash or don’t have a whole week because of work or other factors, we also provide retreat weekends. When joining us, you have to hand in your phone. You'll get it back for the last three days, but only for a few hours a day. On the weekends, you don’t get to use your phone at all. By doing this, you'll completely focus on yourself, which is your first step in gaining confidence.
	<br>
	<br>
	Our trips will be located at a beatiful villa in Bali. When joining us, you'll get to experience the biggest step in believing in and loving yourself. 
	<br>
	We’ll use experts to teach things like yoga and meditation to find peace. Also speeches will be given by women who know all about insecurities and how to overcome them. 
	<br>
	Every day will be filled with educational workshops, speeches, discussion groups and many more activities. After this experience, you'll come back stronger, empowered and confident and you'll kick your insecurities out of the way. 
	<br>
	<br>
	So, are you ready to find your inner Bliss?</p>
